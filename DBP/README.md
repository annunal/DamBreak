# The Dam Break Platform description
## Introduction
The <b>Dam Break PLatform (DBP)</b> is a web application that streamlines and facilitates the estimation of the consequences of Dam Break events. It relies on several scripts that were published in this gitHub site, wrapped around a web tool that facilitates the preparation and running of a new event.

## Methodology
The dam break event preparation includes a number of actions to be performed, summarized here:
- definition of the domain area
- creation of the bathymetry area and identification of the lake
- definition of the break size,  gauges points and other relevant parameters, such as the problem time
- running the case
- analysis

### Domain area
The domain area contains the whole lake upstram the dam and the expected flow path downstrea.
