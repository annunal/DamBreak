# The Dam Break Platform description
## Introduction
The <b>Dam Break PLatform (DBP)</b> is a web application that streamlines and facilitates the estimation of the consequences of Dam Break events. It relies on several scripts that were published in this gitHub site, wrapped around a web tool that facilitates the preparation and running of a new event.

## Methodology
The dam break event preparation includes a number of actions to be performed, summarized here:
- definition of the domain area
- creation of the bathymetry area and identification of the lake
- definition of the break size,  gauges points and other relevant parameters, such as the problem time
- running the case
- analysis

### Selection of the dam to analyse
By clicking on Dams tab you can identify the country in which the dam is located

Let's assume Italy.  The identify the dam for which you want to perform the analysis, let's suppose Santa Rosalia in Sicily


### Domain area
The domain area contains the whole lake upstram the dam and the expected flow path downstream. To select the domain area you can either define the bounding box filling the fields in the form or use the map and move the Bottom left and Top right icons that define the domain area
